# 🤖 Virtual Assistant – My First Python Project

This is my first ever Python project: a simple voice-based virtual assistant that responds to basic voice commands using speech recognition and text-to-speech.

Built while I was learning Python, this assistant helped me understand how real-world tasks can be automated with code. It's a beginner-friendly yet exciting introduction to hands-on development.
